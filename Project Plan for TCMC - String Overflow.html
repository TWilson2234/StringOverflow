<h1>CP1406/CP2010 - 2015 - TCMC Project Plan</h1>   
<h2>String Overflow</h2>
<p><strong>Members: </strong>Jazmin Breadley - jc321455 (Jazzals), Travis Wilson - jc320109 (Tukeyan), Issara Singtothong - jc320588 (Issara62), Ethan Jones - jc249696 (Xett), Troy Waters - jc259071 (Yoshiminu)</p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>The remaking of the Townsville Community Music Center site will ultimately bring the organisation to the modern era with a up-to date website that will attract the general public to attend the various music concerts, showcases and workshops as well as increaseing engagement throughout the community. The current website is sorely outdated design wise and functionality wise and the redesign will hopefully fix these problems. The goal of the website will be to entice people to attended events hosted by the TCMC and increase engagement with the group by volenteers or people signing up for a year long membership.<br><br>
Please halp. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>With the development of the website, the sucess will be evaluated through various criteria. These will include how much more tickets are sold and how many more people attend the events. Another factor to look at is if there is an increased amount of engagement with the community, whether it is by more membership registerations, more volenteers, or more jobs being taken for each concert. Lastly, the amount of events will also be monitored to see if there is an increase in performers and groups willing to side with TCMC.

    </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The demographic for this website is the general public and all those who are interested and involved with music. The current musicians and musical groups are mainly comprised of men and women aged 30-50 which would lead to belive that the readers of the website will be friends and family of these musicians and thus around the same age bracket. However the website cannot only target this demographic as it would alienate other audiences. The audience will have a very diverse taste in music and genres so this must also be taken into consideration so the website is not soley classical, rock, vocals ect.   
    <br><br>
    <strong>Need to Say how we are targetting that audience, design wise.</strong>
